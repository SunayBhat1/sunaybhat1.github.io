## My Story

I was born and raised in Knoxville, Tennessee — Go Vols.

As a competitive junior and collegiate tennis player, I played in national and international tournaments and was a proud member of the UT men's tennis team from 2013–2017. Tennis was an integral part of my early life, and I believe the lessons that come from competitive sports — discipline, handling adversity, being a good teammate — are some of the most valuable things I've ever learned.

I graduated with a BS in Electrical Engineering, then spent three years working in defense at Lockheed Martin Santa Barbara Focalplane as a Test and Systems Engineer. Moving to California unlocked a whole new set of obsessions: I became an avid surfer, picked up hiking and backpacking, and generally try to spend as much time outside as possible.

I returned to graduate school in fall 2020 to join UCLA's Electrical and Computer Engineering Department as an MS/PhD student, focusing on causal generative models, robustness, and interpretable AI. I'm always looking for the next interesting read in macroeconomics, behavioral science, and policy.

In Summer 2024, I married the love of my life, Cindy Pham, who I met while working at Lockheed Martin in Santa Barbara. We got married in Buellton, CA surrounded by family, friends, and — most importantly — our dog, Matcha. We currently live in Los Angeles, doing our best to get outdoors, find interesting places to eat, and travel when we can.

## Community

During my time at UT, I lost a close friend and teammate who battled a rare pediatric cancer while still competing in tennis and inspiring our entire program. The [Sean Karl Foundation](https://seankarlfoundation.org), started by Sean's family and friends in his memory, works to bring awareness and raise funds for research into Ewing's Sarcoma and other rare pediatric cancers.

## Some quotes I keep coming back to

> "The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run." — Thoreau

> "The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most brilliant man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him." — Tolstoy

> "The person you are right now is as transient, as fleeting, and as temporary as all the people you've ever been. The one constant in life is change." — Dan Gilbert

> "Karma is just you, repeating your patterns, virtues, and flaws until you finally get what you deserve." — Naval

> "If you are lucky, your solution becomes the next generation's problems." — Ezra Klein
