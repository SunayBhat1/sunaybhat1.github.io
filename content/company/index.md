## StreetMetrics

I'm the CTO at [StreetMetrics](https://streetmetrics.io), where we build data and intelligence infrastructure for the out-of-home (OOH) advertising industry.

OOH — billboards, transit ads, place-based screens — has historically been one of the least data-rich channels in advertising. StreetMetrics changes that: we measure real-world audience exposure and campaign performance at scale, bringing the rigor of digital measurement to physical media.
