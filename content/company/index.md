[StreetMetrics](https://streetmetrics.com) is a data, analytics, intelligence, measurement, and attribution platform for the out-of-home (OOH) advertising industry. Founded in 2016, we provide near real-time campaign analytics for ads on billboards, buses, walls, trains, taxis, bikes, semi-trailers, and anything else that sits or moves through public spaces.

The company started because our founder, Drew Jackson, needed a way to prove that ads on his family's semi-trailers were actually working. No solution existed, so he built one. That scrappy origin has scaled into the industry's leading measurement platform for moving OOH media, and increasingly for stationary formats like billboards, street furniture, and wallscapes.

Today we measure human behavior at scale across approximately 1.6 million inventory units, processing hundreds of gigabytes of data monthly. Media operators, agencies, and brands use StreetMetrics to plan campaigns, measure exposure, and attribute real-world outcomes — connecting physical-world ad impressions to downstream consumer behavior. The core value proposition is simple: bring OOH measurement on par with digital.

## My Role

I joined StreetMetrics in 2023 as a Data Scientist and ML Engineer while finishing my PhD at UCLA. I now serve as CTO, leading the technology organization across data engineering, platform infrastructure, machine learning, and product development.

My focus is scaling our core methodology, integrating intelligence through AI insights and agentic tools, expanding data partnerships, and keeping our platform ahead of an industry that's rapidly converging with the digital ad ecosystem — from Kubernetes infrastructure and data pipelines to AI roadmap and system architecture. Our tech team is focused on adding customer and industry value, moving fast by utilizing the exponential improvements in AI tools while staying hyper-focused on our customers' needs and the tools that make their lives easier.

## StreetMetrics Intelligence

In 2024 we launched **StreetMetrics Intelligence** — the first AI-native planning and sales tool built specifically for OOH. It was the first OOH platform to offer inventory search, campaign planning, campaign simulation, and RFP response generation through an agentic interface.

What used to take days of back-and-forth — a buyer submitting an RFP, operators manually pulling inventory, building a proposal in a spreadsheet — now happens in minutes. SmartSearch lets operators identify and pitch unsold or underperforming inventory to the right buyers in a few clicks. Our agent reads an incoming brief, queries live inventory, runs campaign simulations, and drafts a structured proposal automatically today, with so much more coming soon.

The broader thesis: OOH has always lagged digital in tooling, not because the data isn't there, but because the infrastructure to surface it intelligently hasn't existed. SmartSearch is currently the only OOH-specific AI agent in the industry. Intelligence is our bet that the future of OOH buying and selling looks a lot more like modern digital ad tech — real-time, data-driven, and AI-assisted at every step.

## What We're Building

OOH advertising has historically been planned on rough estimates — legacy audience models, outdated traffic counts, gut feel. Digital advertising moved past that a decade ago. StreetMetrics is helping OOH catch up, and the foundation is a comprehensive data layer that makes OOH measurable, comparable, and intelligent.

Our platform calculates gross, qualified, and viewable impressions alongside reach, frequency, and unique audience metrics — with viewability sliced by hour, day, and month. For any given piece of inventory, we can map exposure heatmaps showing mobility patterns throughout the day, frame-level viewability zones, geographic audience distribution, and journey mapping. That granularity is what makes real measurement — and real intelligence — possible.

Our broader strategy centers on a few ideas. First, the convergence of digital and OOH — we study programmatic buying, real-time bidding, and audience targeting from the digital world and apply those patterns to physical media.

Second, a data flywheel. More data improves our models, better models attract more clients, more clients generate more data. Reconciliations and outcome insights feed modeling, which improves impression estimates, which improves planning — a compounding loop. [Strategic data partnerships](https://streetmetrics.com/blog-posts/streetmetrics-and-accretive-launch-next-generation-measurement-solution-to-future-proof-the-out-of-home-industry) accelerate this.

Third, AI as an accelerator. We use ML and LLMs throughout our stack for data processing, anomaly detection, and product features — but the philosophy is that AI enhances decision-making without replacing deep system understanding. As measurement evolves into intelligence, and intelligence evolves into automation, OOH will reach operational parity with digital in agility and accountability. ***If the industry is discussing the same day-to-day problems a year from now, we haven't moved fast enough.***

Finally, format expansion. We started with transit media and have since expanded to stationary OOH — billboards, street furniture, wallscapes — with top media owners already using our stationary measurement in major markets. The vision is one platform that measures all OOH formats.

## Team & Culture

We're a lean, distributed team of ~15 spanning engineering, product, sales, marketing, and client services. Small team, big surface area — everyone owns real problems.

The culture runs on a few principles we actually live by: family and health come first, always. We ship honest work over perfect work. We operate with a "GYSHIDO" mindset — independent execution, no micro-management. "We > I" — collaborative by default, good intentions assumed. And we obsess over details, from data pipeline architecture to the pixels in our dashboards. Check out our LinkedIn and careers page for any openings.

## Mission & Vision

**Mission:** Drive growth for OOH media operators by providing actionable planning, measurement, and attribution solutions.

**Vision:** Build the next generation of out-of-home planning, measurement, and sales technology by understanding how people interact with the physical world around them.

We believe relevant advertising is better for both people and businesses. We use technology to contextualize information, empower advertisers, and improve the quality of outdoor media — while being responsible stewards of the data consumers have opted to share.
