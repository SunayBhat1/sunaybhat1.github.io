##### Abstract

We introduce CSHTEST and CSVHTEST, novel architectures for causal model hypothesis testing and data generation. These models use non-parametric structural causal knowledge and approximate a causal model's functional relationships using deep neural networks. The architectures are tested on extensive simulated DAGs, a synthetic pendulum dataset, and a real-world medical trauma dataset to demonstrate practical use for causal inference.
